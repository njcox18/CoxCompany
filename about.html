                        <p>The Edward H. Cox Company is committed to maintaining a leadership position in our industry thru quality products and services for our customers. We take this commitment very seriously and have been doing so since 1935; this is why we can state with pride that we have been <strong>“Providing Applied HVAC Solutions for 3 generations”</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Edward H. Cox attended Syracuse University and in 1935 established the Edward H. Cox Company as a manufacturer’s representative for boiler room equipment and heating control systems. Throughout his 30 years at the helm, the Cox Company continued to provide heating and ventilating solutions, establishing many long-term relationships with mechanical contractors and design engineers in Western New York.</p>
                        <p>James W. Cox joined the company in 1960 after serving as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Navy as an on-board engineering officer. He was a graduate of Brown University and worked side by side with his father, continuing to grow the business. Edward H. Cox died in 1964 leaving James and partner Fred Bardo to continue the business together until Fred’s death in 1978. During this time, the company expanded its product offering into institutional and commercial HVAC markets. Ken Ottaway joined the company in 1982 and helped to grow the customer base and strengthen the product offering. He was followed by the Cox Company’s third generation with the addition of Jim’s sons David and William in the late 1980’s. Upon Jim’s retirement, ownership was transferred to William, David and Ken as it continues today.</p>
                        <p>The marketplace has evolved over the years, but the Cox Company has met the challenge and continues to provide products and services to the heating and ventilation professionals of WNY. We pride ourselves on our service and expertise, always keeping our customers’ needs first and foremost.</p>
